1. place token

2.  I will allow the user to select a column and row they want to place their marker in
by asking for an integer between 1 and 3. 

3. Is winner method, doesn't need to take arguments

4. computerTurn() would be one function. It would accept the token its playing as an argument, and its
function is to randomly pick a tile on the board and send it into place token method.
playerTurn() would be another. It would accept the token its playing as an argument, and its function
is to accept player input and validate it, then run the place token method with the user inputed numbers.

5. I plan to break each type of win condition into their own separate list (columns, rows, diagonals).
Then I will check each nested list in the win condition type, and see if when I make a set out of the row
that it equals 1, since sets don't repeat elements. And if so then there is a winner.
